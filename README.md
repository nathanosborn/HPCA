HPC automation for Geology Simulations

Durham University Geology department are investigating enhanced methods for the extraction of oil.
Molecular simulations are run, based on parameters specified using the linux command line.
This system is to automate the specification of parameters into a small GUI that creates the text file that serves as input to a simulation run.

The program is written in Java using the swing GUI framework.
